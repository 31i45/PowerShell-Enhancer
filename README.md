1. You need to set Powershell 7 as the default in Windows Terminal.

2. The v1 version set a default theme, and some basic improvements.

3. The v2 version changes theme every hour, improves a lot of course.

4. I am debugging the v3 version now, it stops some dangerous commands.
   Any way the v2 version is really enough for us.
